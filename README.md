# mma_dashboard

my intention going in:

- scrape some MMA data, because all the buffest guys and the hottest chicks dig MMA data
- attempt to build an anlysis dashboard for the resultant data (plotly? streamlit?) as i have no experience doing this and it seems like an employable skill to have
- maybe look into some kind of database solution for the data?
- maybe try to answer some meaningful questions this time?
- maybe try to derive some sense of accomplishment from whatever mess is produced?
- to take the rest of the code to the next level, I'd like to implement pep8 in the docstrings and pytest for the unit tests

guess first step to all of this is to scrape the data, I think some websites worth starting to look in might be:

- http://ufcstats.com/statistics/fighters
- ... actually that one has pretty much all i really need once I boil it down.

I think once we've scraped, it might be worth seeing if any kind of cleaning / classifying / general wrangling work on the data can be built into a pipeline since that also seems quite useful and given the nture of the sport as an ongoing narative it makes sense that any given data set that i produce wouldnt be like the *final* dataset but rather just the current one.
