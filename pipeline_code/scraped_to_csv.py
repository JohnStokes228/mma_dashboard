"""
I've scraped some additional data from wikipedia, but due to the websites rather chaotic nature some amount of post
processing is required to get it into a shape where it can be joined to the rest of the data. I wont save these to csv
alone, but rather as part of the merged master file, just to cut down on excess files and since I know if i need to
repeat the scrape that the data will need re transforming.

The camp data is both the hardest to make useful and the least useful once transformed so hurray for wasted efforts I
guess.

TODO: - write functions to transform camp data <- this one will be much harder :(

    Notes
    -----
    Function returns strictly the alphabetic characters of the input string so for instance 'John123' would return only
    'John'. This is also true for special characters i.e. 'SuflÃ©' would yield 'Sufl'. This is fine for our purposes as
    my web scrapers already unidecode the strings they scrape to avoid issues such as this but for data not coming from
    my own scrapers, unidecode-ing the input string first would be strongly recommended.
